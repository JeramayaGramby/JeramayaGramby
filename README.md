I build intelligent and efficient systems that merge data engineering, cloud automation, and low-level computing into practical, high-impact solutions. 

My work bridges software and hardware, spanning from embedded C++ systems and microprocessor optimization to Python-based analytics and machine learning applications that drive decision-making.

My curiosity for cross-disciplinary design has led me to develop both a C++ technical indicator generator and a Python financial analytics engine, tools that work together to evaluate market data and compute performance metrics such as Sharpe Ratios across stock and cryptocurrency portfolios. I also built an ML.NET regression model that predicts used car prices that you can learn more about on Medium. I built it for my friends so we all could make smarter car-buying decisions.

Beyond software, I’m deeply interested in hardware development, material science, and photonics. I also spend time experimenting with resurrected microprocessors and motherboards that are either running live tests or waiting for their next experiment/project. 

Being AWS Cloud Certified gives me the courage to design scalable, fault-tolerant cloud systems and leverage Terraform and CI/CD automation to integrate machine learning and real-time data processing at scale. 
So long as the underlying program works consistently, clarity, reproducibility, and documentation are my top priorities in systems design.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about football, basketball, cars, and writing programs and building physical hardware that solve problems.
