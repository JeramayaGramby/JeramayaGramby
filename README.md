Software Engineering Student | Cloud Developer | Data Enthusiast

My keen interest in machine learning, data science and cloud technologies has led me to create impactful applications in **C#**, **Python** and **Java**. 

In a recent financial data engineering project, I conducted Sharpe Ratio analysis on daily closing price data to compare the performance of a stock portfolio with that of a cryptocurrency portfolio. This project sharpened my ability to derive valuable insights from complex datasets.

My cloud projects include a Python-based cloud automation script utilizing the AWS SDK and a Terraform project that integrates a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for an Auto Scaling Group in AWS.

Furthermore, my **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification has equipped me with the expertise to architect robust and scalable cloud-based solutions and positively contribute to cloud and DevOps teams.

Effective communication in technical workplaces is vital and is why I create transparency through my consise technical writing and comprehensive documentation.

Beyond my professional pursuits, my interests include football, basketball, cars and time-traveling.
