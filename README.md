Software Engineering Student | Passionate Developer | Data Enthusiast

As a devoted software engineering student, I am driven by my passion for continuous learning and development. My keen interest in machine learning and data science has led me to create impactful applications in both **C#** and **Python**. My previously completed courses in **Java** and **SQL** have allowed me to further expand my tech stack and capabilities.

In a recent financial data engineering project, I conducted Sharpe Ratio analysis to compare the performance of a stock portfolio with that of a cryptocurrency portfolio. This project not only enhanced my understanding of financial data but also sharpened my analytical skills, highlighting my ability to derive valuable insights from complex datasets.

My exploration in the realm of DevOps includes the implementation of a Python cloud automation script utilizing the AWS SDK, as well as a Terraform project that integrates a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for an Auto Scaling Group. These experiences reflect my proficiency in orchestrating efficient and scalable cloud infrastructure, emphasizing my ability to streamline development processes.

Furthermore, my **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification has equipped me with the expertise to architect robust and scalable cloud-based solutions and positively contribute to cloud and DevOps teams.

With my strong focus on purposeful communication, I excel in technical writing and forming comprehensive documentation, ensuring transparency and simplified knowledge transfer among tech professionals.

Beyond my professional pursuits, my interests include nature, football, basketball and automotive history.
